# SER502-Funlang-Team29
# **Overview:**
- This repository contains the source code, documentation, and demonstration materials for the implementation of "Funlang", a custom programming language designed and developed as part of a team project for the SER502 course.
- Dive into FUNLANG – a programming language designed to make writing code simpler, intuitive, and, most importantly, fun with every line of code.

# **Basic flow**

TOOLS that are used: 
- The parsing technique that we would be utilizing for the project is a ‘Top-down’ descent parser. This is the common approach for parsing context-free grammars.
- Recursive Descent Parser: Each non-terminal in grammar corresponds to a parsing function. These functions recursively call each other to parse the input according to the grammar rules defined.
